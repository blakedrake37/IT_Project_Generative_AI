### Step 1: Clone the Project Repository:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired project directory using the cd command (e.g., cd Documents/MyProjects).
Clone the repository using Git:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/blakedrake37/IT_Project_Generative_AI.git
```
This will download the project files to a new directory named IT_Project_Generative_AI.

### Step 2: Create Required Folders:

Navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd IT_Project_Generative_AI
```
Create the following folders within the project directory:
```bash
mkdir chat_sessions chroma_db models
```
- chat_sessions: This folder will store your chat history data (if applicable).
- chroma_db: This folder will be used for the Chroma database, which might be used for storing and managing embeddings (data representations) generated by the models.
- models: This folder will hold the downloaded pre-trained models.

### Step 3: Download Pre-trained Models:

Go to TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-GGUF) and download the mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q5_K_M.gguf model file.
Place the downloaded file in the models folder.

Similarly, visit uonlp/Vistral-7B-Chat-gguf on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/uonlp/Vistral-7B-Chat-gguf) and download the ggml-vistral-7B-chat-f16.gguf model file.

Place this file in the models folder as well.

### Step 4: Install Dependencies:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate back to the project directory if you've switched directories.

Choose one of the following methods to install the required Python packages:

#### Method A: Install All Packages from requirements.txt (Recommended):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command will read a file named requirements.txt (which might be present in the project) and install all the listed dependencies in one go.

#### Method B: Install Specific Packages (Manual):
```bash
pip install langchain langchain_community streamlit pypdfium2 wikipedia youtube-search chromadb
```
This method explicitly mentions the individual packages you need. If there are any missing libraries during requirements.txt installation, you can install them using this method.

### Step 5: Set Up the Database:

If the project involves using ChromaDB for storing embeddings, you might need to run a script to set it up (the specific steps may vary depending on the project's implementation).
Refer to the project's documentation or code comments for instructions related to database setup. The script might be named database_operations.py, but this could vary. Execute it using:
```bash
python database_operations.py
```
### Step 6: Run the Application:

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate back to the project directory.
Start the Streamlit app using (make sure you've activated your virtual environment if you're using one):
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This will launch the web application, usually accessible in your browser at http://localhost:8501 (the exact port might differ).

### Additional Notes:

If you encounter any errors during installation or execution, refer to the project's documentation or online resources for troubleshooting steps.
